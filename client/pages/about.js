                                My name is Alexandr and I live in Kyiv, Ukraine.
                            </p>

                                I have always loved creating something out of nothing. When I was little I started with lego-modeling, moved on to sewing my own clothes and creating jewelry, and then I found the digital world where it was possible to create anything! I started creating anything and everything; logos, digital design work, even tried 3D models, and finally websites.
                            </p>

                            <p className="doc">
                                Today I primarily create websites. I also work with web development both front-end and back-end, specifically with ReactJS and NodeJS as well.
                            </p>

                            <p className="doc">
                                My web-journey began early, just me working on my own. In later years, I have also received formal education as I studied web technology at the university to help me to widen and deepen my knowledge.

                                Besides, programming I love spending time with friends, can often be found together going out catching the latest movie, staying in playing games table games or planning a trip to someplace I've never been before.

                                Althought I'm big fan of sport activities such as basketball, football and tennis, even table tennis. Sport is a great way to get your mind off things and is also a great way to express yourself. It can work your whole body after hard coding :).

                                I graduated from university National Aviation University, which is situated in Kyiv. Where I studied system programming and got some knowledge about OOP languages. While I was at university I worked part time as a invigilaton who helped to conduct exam in British Council Office. That helped me to further hone in my english skills. When I'm not at work I'm usually working on a new pet-project from home which could be anything to updating one of my project or to create a new CRM/CMS application.

                                Before studing myselft web development I was insipred by C# language and wanted to link my future job with WPF. However, web developing trends started to displace desktop application. Therefore, I was aimed at developing for web apps. Starting from ASP.NET to custom NodeJS server and React(NextJS) framework.
